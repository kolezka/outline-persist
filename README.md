# worklog-persist

A focused Claude Code plugin that gives your sessions a **durable work-state
layer** backed by the Outline MCP server. It preserves the state of active
engineering work between agent sessions: what task is in progress, what was
verified, what changed, which decisions were made, what is blocked, and what the
next action is.

It is a persistence layer only. Graph synchronization, reflection promotion and
curriculum clustering are deliberately **not** part of this plugin.

The plugin is named `worklog-persist`, not `outline-persist`: the `outline` name
belongs to the Outline MCP server and the separate `outline`
KB skill, and a plugin with the same name shadows them. Only the plugin identity
changed. The MCP server entry, `OUTLINE_API_TOKEN` and the Outline document
routing are untouched.

## What it does

- Reads current work context from Outline before non-trivial work.
- Records task start, verified checkpoints, handoff and completion.
- Keeps one record per work item (idempotency key = resolved project + task slug),
  so repeated checkpoints update rather than duplicate.
- Redacts secret-shaped values before anything is written.
- Never claims a write succeeded unless Outline confirms it; states plainly when
  Outline is unavailable and continues.

## Install

Requires the `claude` CLI and an `outline` MCP server reachable via the standard
transport (`https://outline.raqz.link/mcp`, Cloudflare Access + Bearer token, all
from environment variables — no credentials are stored in this repo).

```bash
make                         # every target, with a one-line description each
./install.sh                 # dry-run by default: prints the plan, touches nothing
./install.sh --apply         # execute, confirming each step
./install.sh --apply --yes   # non-interactive
./install.sh --check         # validate plugin structure only (no claude needed)

make plan                    # == ./install.sh
make install                 # == ./install.sh --apply, and REFUSES from a worktree
```

`--apply` refuses to run from a linked git worktree. `marketplace add` records the
checkout path, and a worktree path is deleted with its branch.

Re-running `./install.sh --apply` is safe: it skips the marketplace add and plugin install
if they are already present, and never edits your `settings.json` or a shared
`mcp.json` — the `claude` CLI manages its own registry, so unrelated marketplaces,
plugins, MCP servers and hooks are left untouched.

## Renamed from `outline-persist`

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| plugin and skill `outline-persist` | `worklog-persist` |
| marketplace `outline-persist-marketplace` | `worklog-persist-marketplace` |
| env `OUTLINE_HOOK_OFF` | `WORKLOG_HOOK_OFF` |
| env `OUTLINE_PERSIST_LIVE` | `WORKLOG_PERSIST_LIVE` |
| state dir `~/.local/state/outline-persist` | `~/.local/state/worklog-persist` |

Uninstall the old plugin before installing this one:
`claude plugin uninstall outline-persist@<marketplace>`. The off-state file does not
migrate. If automatic persistence was disabled, run
`bash scripts/persistence-state.sh off` once after the reinstall.

## Enable / disable

The plugin can be disabled without uninstalling it:

```bash
/off                                         # inside a session (slash command)
bash scripts/persistence-state.sh off        # or from a shell
bash scripts/persistence-state.sh on         # re-enable
WORKLOG_HOOK_OFF=1                            # env override forces off

./install.sh --apply --disable                # disable the whole plugin
./install.sh --apply --enable
./install.sh --apply --uninstall
```

When disabled, the SessionStart hook stops injecting the durable-memory rule and
no automatic writes happen. The manual commands still work.

## Commands

Eight slash commands map to the persistence lifecycle:

| Command       | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `/load`       | Load current work-state before substantive work (read-only). |
| `/start`      | Create or update the task record with objective + acceptance criteria. |
| `/checkpoint` | Update the same record after a verified milestone. |
| `/handoff`    | Write a compact handoff state when a session ends or is blocked. |
| `/complete`   | Record the real completion result with verification outcomes. |
| `/dry-run`    | Show the intended read/write (with redaction visible), change nothing. |
| `/off`        | Disable automatic persistence without removing the plugin. |
| `/setup`      | Route this repo to an Outline world, or mark it as not persisted. |

The full operational contract lives in `skills/worklog-persist/SKILL.md`, which
also auto-activates by description — the robust driver even where the SessionStart
hook's context injection is affected by known Claude Code bugs
([#16538](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16538),
[#88086](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/88086)).

## Persisted record schema

Structured state, not a transcript. Minimum fields: repository identity; project
and world; branch and worktree; task slug; objective; acceptance criteria; status
(`active` / `blocked` / `handoff` / `complete`); verified facts and evidence;
inferred/unverified items; decisions; changed files; test and verification
results; blockers; next action; related documents; `Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD`.

## KB structure and routing

The plugin reads its own config file: `$WORKLOG_CONFIG`, else
`~/.config/worklog-persist/config.yaml`. It is YAML and needs PyYAML
(`python3 -m pip install pyyaml`, or your system package). Without PyYAML, or
with a missing or broken file, the resolver never crashes. It reports
`config_error` and falls back to `$WORKLOG_WORLD`.

```yaml
outline:
  root_collection: My KB
  global_collection: Notebook
  archive_collection: Archive
worlds:
  - name: Alpha
    projects:
      - {name: my-project, repo: ~/code/my-project}
      - {name: other-project, repo: ~/code/other, kb_folder: My KB/Alpha/custom-folder}
ignore:
  - ~/scratch
```

- Collections (`root_collection`, `global_collection`, `archive_collection`) come
  from the `outline:` block. A key left out keeps its built-in default.
- A repo declared under `worlds[].projects[]` gets its world, project name and
  optional `kb_folder` from the config. A linked git worktree resolves to its
  main checkout first, so it maps to the same project.
- An undeclared repo uses `$WORKLOG_WORLD`, else the world stays `UNRESOLVED`.
  A repo under `ignore`, or below an ignored dir, gets no world and no folder.
- Records live at `<kb_path>/Tasks/<task-slug>`, where `kb_path` is `kb_folder` or
  `<root_collection>/<World>/<project>`. Ticket slugs (`AD-163-uat-checklist`)
  are accepted.
- Bootstrap is the plugin's own rule: a world folder gets `INDEX` only, a project
  folder gets `INDEX`, `Specs`, `Plans`, `Tasks`. It is idempotent.
- When the MCP server is down, `/load` says persistence is unavailable. There is
  no local fallback.

Upgrading from 0.2: the old shared manifest and its world env var are no longer
read. The schema is the same, so you can copy the entries you need into the file
above, or run `/setup` once per repo.

### Onboarding a repo

You do not have to write the config yourself. When a session starts in a repo
that is not declared (or there is no config yet) and `WORKLOG_WORLD` is unset,
the SessionStart hook tells the agent to run onboarding first. `/setup` runs the
same flow on demand. The agent lists the worlds that already exist as top-level
documents in `root_collection`, asks you once (pick a world, name a new one, or
do not persist this repo), and records the answer with:

```bash
bash scripts/config-add.sh project --world Alpha --name my-project --repo ~/code/my-project
bash scripts/config-add.sh ignore --repo ~/scratch
```

`config-add.sh` creates the file if needed, keeps existing entries, does nothing
on a repeat, refuses to move a repo to another world, and never rewrites a file
it cannot parse. It rewrites the file in full, so YAML comments in it are lost.

Check what a repo resolves to:

```bash
bash scripts/resolve-context.sh my-task-slug
```

## Tests

```bash
make check    # everything offline: pytest suite, shell suites, structure check
make lint     # shellcheck at warning severity
make live     # opt-in reachability check against the Outline server in .mcp.json
```

Offline tests use local fixtures and mocks; the live test is opt-in and needs no
credentials in CI.

## Documentation

`docs/` describes the plugin by building block: each block has `README`,
`CONTRACTS`, `INVARIANTS`, `GAPS` and `OPERATIONS` pages. Start at
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md). Rules for writing there are in
[`docs/CONVENTIONS.md`](docs/CONVENTIONS.md), and `tests/test_docs_layout.py`
enforces them.

## Scope boundary

This plugin covers Outline persistence only: the skill, its SessionStart rule,
the slash commands and the `outline` MCP entry. It has no reflection, no graph
sync and no curriculum. It reads no config but its own.
