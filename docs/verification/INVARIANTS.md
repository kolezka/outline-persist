# Invariants

Numbered behaviours the test suite itself must keep. Each one names the defect it
prevents. See [`CONTRACTS.md`](CONTRACTS.md) for the entry points these suites run
under.

---

1. **The installer suite never invokes the real `claude` binary.**
   `tests/test_install.sh` puts a stub ahead of the real CLI on `PATH` before the
   first case runs, and every case restores `PATH` implicitly by exiting the
   script. [verified] Defect prevented: a test run silently registering a fake
   marketplace or plugin in the developer's real `claude` CLI registry.

2. **A `list` call is never counted as a mutation.**
   `tests/test_install.sh::mutations()` filters `marketplace list` and
   `plugin list` out of the call log before checking for unwanted mutation.
   [verified] Defect prevented: a suite that reports "read-only" success while
   masking a real accidental write, because the read-only `list` calls padded the
   log and hid the write among them.

3. **Off-switch tests run against an isolated state directory.**
   `tests/test_offswitch.sh` creates a fresh directory with `mktemp -d` and
   exports it as `XDG_STATE_HOME` before calling `persistence-state.sh` or
   `session-start.sh`. [verified] Defect prevented: a test run permanently
   flipping the off-switch in the developer's real state directory, silencing the
   hook outside the test.

4. **`resolve-context.sh` is checked for exactly one world assignment.**
   `tests/test_context.sh::"single world assignment"` counts occurrences of
   `world="` in the script and requires exactly one. [verified] Defect prevented:
   a second, hardcoded world literal added next to the sanctioned
   `KB_WORLD`-or-sentinel assignment, defeating the world-agnostic contract
   without any single test catching the specific hardcoded value.

5. **Redaction is checked against ordinary text, not only against secrets.**
   `tests/test_redact.py::test_preserves_ordinary_text()` asserts a plain
   checkpoint body passes through `redact()` byte for byte. [verified] Defect
   prevented: an overly broad redaction pattern corrupting normal work notes,
   which a suite that only fed it secrets would never catch.

6. **Redaction is checked for idempotence.**
   `tests/test_redact.py::test_idempotent()` asserts that redacting an
   already-redacted string is a no-op. [verified] Defect prevented: a second write
   through the same pipeline mangling a `<REDACTED:...>` marker left by the first
   pass.

7. **The citation and link checks carry a positive control against a silently
   empty result.**
   `tests/test_docs_layout.py::"checked > 30"` and the equivalent `checked > 10`
   bound on links both fail loudly if the counting regex stops matching anything.
   [verified] Defect prevented: a future refactor of the checker (or a change to
   the citation syntax) making every doc look clean because nothing was checked at
   all, not because nothing was broken.

8. **The live suite fails safe when unconfigured.**
   `tests/test_live_outline.sh` exits `0` with a `SKIP:` message when
   `tests/test_live_outline.sh::"WORKLOG_PERSIST_LIVE"` is unset, and aborts on
   its own precondition check if `OUTLINE_API_TOKEN` is missing even when that
   flag is set. [verified] Defect prevented: a developer being tempted to hardcode
   a token in the repo, or `make check` failing in every environment that lacks
   network access, just to keep an opt-in reachability probe green.

9. **`test_docs_layout.py` checks the whole `docs/` tree, not just one block.**
   `tests/test_docs_layout.py::_docs()` globs `docs/**/*.md` from the repository
   root rather than a single block folder. [verified] Defect prevented: this
   block's own docs passing review while another block's front matter, ownership
   claim or citation is silently broken.
