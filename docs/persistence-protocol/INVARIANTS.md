# Invariants

Numbered behaviours the protocol text requires, and what breaks if a session
does not follow them. None of these are enforced at agent run time; see
[`GAPS.md`](GAPS.md) for what that means in practice.

---

### 1. Never write a secret into a persisted record

`skills/worklog-persist/SKILL.md::"Never persist secrets"` [verified]. Every
write-capable command routes the body through `scripts/redact.py::redact()`
first, e.g. `commands/start.md::"Pipe the body through"` [verified]. Defect
prevented: a durable, shared wiki record permanently holding a live API key,
password or PII, which is worse than a leak in a transcript because Outline is
built to be found and reused later [inferred: the skill's own framing of
Outline as durable makes an unredacted secret durable too].

### 2. Confirm availability before any read or write

`skills/worklog-persist/SKILL.md::"confirm the server is connected"` [verified].
Defect prevented: silently skipping the read/write step and letting the agent
proceed on stale or absent context without saying so, or worse, treating a
failed remote call as if it had succeeded.

### 3. Never claim a write succeeded without a confirming response

`commands/start.md::"Do not claim success unless the Outline response confirms the write."`
[verified], repeated for handoff as
`commands/handoff.md::"Report the write only after the Outline response confirms it."`
[verified]. Defect prevented: the next session trusting a record that was never
actually written, because the current session reported success from having
sent the call, not from Outline's response.

### 4. One record per (project, task slug), never a second one

`skills/worklog-persist/SKILL.md::"The record identity is"` [verified];
`commands/checkpoint.md::"idempotency key = project + task slug"` [verified].
Defect prevented: two documents for the same task drifting apart, so `/load` in
a later session reads a stale or partial one depending on which it happens to
find.

### 5. A task slug is validated kebab-case or the script fails loud

`scripts/resolve_context.py::SLUG_RE` [verified]; on mismatch the script exits
`2` rather than returning a malformed slug
(`scripts/resolve_context.py::"invalid task slug"`) [verified]. Defect
prevented: a slug like `My Task` or `Fix_Bug` silently becoming part of the
idempotency key in invariant 4, so two spellings of the same task each get
their own document.

### 6. World comes from the plugin config, `$WORKLOG_WORLD` or a sentinel, never hardcoded

`scripts/resolve_context.py::"WORKLOG_WORLD"` [verified]. Path root reads the
same single config, never another file next to it
(`scripts/resolve_context.py::world_repo_roots()`) [verified]. No other env var
or file feeds it. Defect prevented: the plugin's identity-resolution code naming
one operator's world, or picking one up from another tool's settings, which
would make a session write to the wrong place with no visible cause.
`tests/test_context.sh::"WORKLOG_WORLD honored"` exercises the override path and
`tests/test_context.sh::"old coupling ignored"` proves the pre-0.3 names, and an
overlay manifest next to the old default path, have no effect (test suite only)
[verified].

### 7. Redaction does not rewrite text that was never secret-shaped

`tests/test_redact.py::test_preserves_ordinary_text()` [verified]. Defect
prevented: `redact()` over-matching and corrupting an ordinary record body
(branch names, file paths, prose), which would make the persisted record less
trustworthy than the one it replaced.

### 8. Redaction is idempotent

`tests/test_redact.py::test_idempotent()` [verified]. Defect prevented: running
the filter twice (for instance once in `/checkpoint` and again if a caller
pipes an already-redacted body through it a second time) producing a
double-redacted, harder-to-read artifact such as nested `<REDACTED:` markers.

### 9. Completion is not claimed from file changes alone

`commands/complete.md::"Do not mark complete merely because files changed."`
[verified]. Defect prevented: a task marked `complete` in Outline while its
acceptance criteria were never actually verified, which a later session would
trust at face value per invariant 3's own logic.

### 10. A bad config never crashes the resolver

`scripts/resolve_context.py::load_config()` returns an error string instead of
raising for a missing, unparseable or wrongly shaped file [verified]. Defect
prevented: one broken config file making `resolve-context.sh` exit non-zero,
which would break every command and leave the SessionStart hook without an
identity. `tests/test_context.sh::"malformed config"` and
`tests/test_context.sh::"unparseable config"` cover it (test suite only)
[verified].

### 11. An ignored repo gets no Outline folder, even with `$WORKLOG_WORLD` set

`scripts/resolve_context.py::"An ignored repo has no Outline folder"` [verified].
Defect prevented: an env var set for one repo routing records for a repo the
operator excluded on purpose. `tests/test_context.sh::"ignored beats WORKLOG_WORLD"`
covers it (test suite only) [verified].

### 12. The config writer never clobbers a file it cannot read

`scripts/config_add.py::load()` raises before any write when the existing file
does not parse or fails the shape check, and `main()` returns `1` without
calling `write()` [verified]. Defect prevented: onboarding one repo silently
replacing an operator's hand-kept config with a one-entry file.
`tests/test_config_add.sh::"unparseable file refused"` and
`tests/test_config_add.sh::"malformed file refused"` check the file stays
byte-identical (test suite only) [verified].

### 13. The config writer is idempotent and never moves a repo

The same entry twice leaves the file untouched; a repo declared under another
world is refused (`scripts/config_add.py::add_project()`) [verified]. Defect
prevented: duplicate entries where the first match wins, or records for one
project silently starting to land in another world's folder.
`tests/test_config_add.sh::"idempotent re-add: byte-identical"` and
`tests/test_config_add.sh::"conflict: file untouched"` cover it (test suite
only) [verified].

### 14. World names come from Outline or the user, never from the plugin

Onboarding lists the top-level documents under `root_collection` each time and
never caches them
(`skills/worklog-persist/SKILL.md::"remember or cache world names"`)
[verified]. Defect prevented: a stale or foreign list steering a repo into a
world that does not exist for this operator. Convention only; no test drives
the flow [verified].

### 15. Path root never guesses between worlds

`scripts/resolve_context.py::path_root_world()` returns nothing when two
different worlds tie for the deepest root [verified]. Defect prevented: a repo
in a shared parent dir landing in whichever world happened to be listed first.
`tests/test_context.sh::"equal-depth tie is ambiguous"` covers it (test suite
only) [verified].
