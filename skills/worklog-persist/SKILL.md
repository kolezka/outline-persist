# worklog-persist: durable work-state persistence

Outline is durable; conversation context is volatile. The state of active
engineering work lives in Outline so it survives across sessions: what task is in
progress, what was verified, what changed, which decisions were made, what is
blocked, and what the next action is.

This skill is the operational contract. The eight slash commands
(`/load`, `/start`, `/checkpoint`, `/handoff`, `/complete`, `/dry-run`, `/off`,
`/setup`) are thin entry points that run the relevant part of this contract.

The Outline tools are `list_collections`, `list_documents`, `fetch`,
`create_document`, `update_document` and `move_document`. Their prefix depends on
where the `outline` server is configured:

- `mcp__outline__*` when the user also configures `outline` at user, project or
  local scope. Claude Code then connects once, using that definition.
- `mcp__plugin_worklog-persist_outline__*` when only this plugin's `.mcp.json`
  defines it.

The tools may be deferred. Find them with ToolSearch (query `outline
list_collections`), then load the schemas of the prefix that exists. Never assume
one prefix.

Helper scripts live under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/`:
`resolve-context.sh` (identity), `config-add.sh` (the only config writer),
`redact.py` (secret redaction), `persistence-state.sh` (the off switch).

## Precondition: is Outline available?

Before any read or write, confirm the server is connected: attempt
`list_collections`. If it errors as unavailable, **state once that persistence is
unavailable and continue the task without Outline** — never block work, never
substitute a local success claim for a failed remote write. A local pending
record is allowed only if this repository already has a supported local fallback;
mark it explicitly as `pending, unsynchronized`.

## Never persist secrets

Never write secrets, tokens, API keys, passwords, private keys, cookies, customer
PII, NIPs or account numbers to Outline. Pipe every candidate record body through
`python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/redact.py` before `create_document` /
`update_document`; it replaces secret-shaped values with `<REDACTED:kind>`. If the
user pastes a secret, redact it and warn inline. Do not log authorization headers
or raw MCP payloads.

## Identity and world resolution

Run `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resolve-context.sh [task-slug]`. It prints
JSON. Use its paths as given; never rebuild them by hand.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `world`, `project` | From the plugin config when the repo is declared there, else inferred |
| `world_source` | `config`, `env` (`$WORKLOG_WORLD`), `path-root` or `fallback` |
| `kb_path` | Project folder in Outline (`kb_folder` override, else `<root>/<World>/<project>`) |
| `tasks_path`, `record_path` | `<kb_path>/Tasks` and `<kb_path>/Tasks/<slug>` |
| `root_collection`, `global_collection`, `archive_collection` | From the config `outline:` block |
| `repo_root`, `worktree`, `branch` | `repo_root` is the main checkout, also from a linked worktree |
| `ignored` | The config lists this repo, or a parent dir, under `ignore` |
| `candidate_worlds` | The world names declared in the config |
| `config`, `config_error` | Which config was read, or why none was |
| `config_path` | Where the config is looked for, also when it does not exist |

The config is this plugin's own YAML file: `$WORKLOG_CONFIG`, else
`~/.config/worklog-persist/config.yaml`. Reading it needs PyYAML. Pointing
`WORKLOG_CONFIG` at another file lets the same repo resolve differently per
context. That is intended. Never edit the file by hand: add entries only with
`config-add.sh` (see Onboarding).

- **World** is never hardcoded. Precedence: (1) the repo is declared in the
  config (`world_source` `config`); (2) `$WORKLOG_WORLD` (`env`); (3) path root:
  the config world whose declared repos' common ancestor is the deepest
  ancestor-or-equal of this repo (`path-root`; a tie between two different worlds
  at that depth stays unresolved, never guessed); (4) `UNRESOLVED`. An ignored
  repo gets no world from tiers 2 or 3. On `UNRESOLVED`, run Onboarding (below)
  before any other work. Do not write anything to Outline until the world is
  known. A `path-root` world is resolved, not a guess to confirm; if the operator
  says it is wrong, run `/setup` to declare the repo.
- **Project** is the config `name` when declared (it can differ from the repo
  name), else the basename of `git remote get-url origin`, else the main checkout
  directory name. A worktree directory name is never the project. When the current
  directory is not a git repo at all, project is `workspace`, never the directory's
  basename.
- **Ignored repo**: the operator decided it has no Outline folder. Do not bootstrap
  one. Ask before writing anything for it.
- **Task slug**: lowercase kebab-case, shared across `Specs`/`Plans`/`Tasks`.
  Ticket-backed work prefixes the ticket ID: `AD-163-uat-checklist`.

## Structure and routing

Names in angle brackets come from the resolver.

```
<root_collection>/                 active KB (usually raqz.pl)
  <World>/                         INDEX only
    <project>/                     = kb_path
      INDEX                        project hub
      Specs/  Plans/  Tasks/       parents with child lists
      Tasks/<slug>                 = record_path, one per work item
      Tasks/BACKLOG                trivial items, until they grow up
      Packages/<pkg>/              monorepo sub-packages only
    status-reports/  analizy/      per-world, not project work
<global_collection>                Claude's Notebook: SOUL, CONVENTIONS, LESSONS, STACK-NOTES
<archive_collection>               retired content, Archive/Security
```

- Work records go to `record_path`. Prefer updating an existing doc over a new one.
- Cross-project lessons and conventions go to `global_collection`. Never recreate it
  and never create a second global KB.
- Never delete. To retire a doc, move it to `archive_collection`.
- Outline addresses are chains of **titles**. Renaming a folder or doc breaks every
  `[[link]]` to it. Rename only on request, and across Specs/Plans/Tasks together.
- Document bodies must not begin with an H1. The title is a separate field.

## Bootstrap (lazy, idempotent)

Run before the first write in a session, never before a read-only load.

1. Resolve identity. On `UNRESOLVED` run Onboarding; on an `ignored` repo stop.
2. Resolve each segment of `kb_path` with `list_documents`. Create only what is
   missing, and check each child before you create it. This repairs a partial
   folder and never duplicates.
3. Seeding shape depends on depth: a **world** folder gets `INDEX` only; a
   **project** folder gets `INDEX`, `Specs`, `Plans`, `Tasks`. Never seed
   `Specs`/`Plans`/`Tasks` at world level. Running bootstrap twice creates nothing
   new.
4. A folder that has no `INDEX` is a hub gap. Report it, do not skip it silently.

## Onboarding (unresolved repo)

Run this when the resolver reports `world` = `UNRESOLVED` and `ignored` = false,
and `config_error` is empty or starts with `config not found`. The SessionStart
hook asks for it, and `/setup` runs it. If `config_error` says the file is
unreadable or malformed, do not onboard: report the error and `config_path`, and
ask the operator to fix the file.

1. **Discover worlds.** Run the availability check. If Outline is connected,
   `list_documents` directly under `root_collection` (top level only). Each
   top-level document title there is a world. Read them live every time: never
   hardcode, remember or cache world names.
2. **Ask one question.** Offer: each discovered world, "New world" (the user types
   the name), and "Do not persist this repo". In the same question, confirm the
   project name; the default is the resolver's `project`.
3. **Record the answer** with the script, never by editing the YAML:
   - world picked or typed:
     `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/config-add.sh project --world <World> --name <project> --repo <repo_root>`
   - do not persist:
     `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/config-add.sh ignore --repo <repo_root>`

   Always pass `repo_root`, not the worktree path. A non-zero exit means nothing
   was written: show its message and stop. It refuses a repo already declared
   under another world, and a config file it cannot parse.
4. **Bootstrap.** For a new world, create the world folder under
   `root_collection` with `INDEX` only. Then bootstrap the project folder
   (`INDEX`, `Specs`, `Plans`, `Tasks`) as in Bootstrap above. Skip this for
   "do not persist".
5. **Confirm.** Re-run `resolve-context.sh`. It must now show `world_source` =
   `config` and a `kb_path`, or `ignored` = true. Report the result in one line.

If Outline is not connected: say world discovery is unavailable, and offer only
"New world" (typed name) or "Skip for this session". A typed world may still be
recorded with `config-add.sh`, but write nothing to Outline; bootstrap happens on
the first write once Outline is back. "Skip for this session" writes nothing
anywhere, and the session works without persistence.

## The persisted work record

Persist structured state, not a transcript. Minimum fields:

- repository identity; project and world; branch and worktree;
- task slug; objective; acceptance criteria;
- status: one of `active`, `blocked`, `handoff`, `complete`;
- verified facts and evidence; inferred or unverified items; decisions;
- changed files; test and verification results; blockers; next action;
- related Outline documents; timestamp (`Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD`).

Distinguish **verified / inferred / unverified / blocked** claims explicitly — never
present an unverified claim as verified.

## Idempotency

The record identity is `project` + `task_slug`, realised as the doc at
`record_path`. Before creating, `list_documents` under `tasks_path` and match the
title to the slug. If it exists, `update_document` it. A repeated checkpoint updates
the same record and never duplicates. Never use a timestamp as document identity.

## Status and the `Tasks` parent

The record status and the flag in the `Tasks` parent child-list differ. Map them:

| Record status | `Tasks` flag |
|---|---|
| `active` | `doing` |
| `blocked` | `blocked` |
| `handoff` | `doing` |
| `complete` | `done` |

A new record always goes into the `Tasks` child-list with its flag, and each status
change updates that flag. If the parent is missing, report the record as orphaned.

## Lifecycle (maps to the commands)

- **load** — resolve identity; find the record at `record_path`; read it plus the
  project `INDEX` and linked docs before substantive work; return a concise
  current-state summary. If Outline is unavailable, say persistence is unavailable
  and stop the load.
- **start** — bootstrap if needed; create or update `record_path` with objective, acceptance criteria,
  repo, worktree, branch; link related Specs/Plans/existing docs. Update the `Tasks`
  parent child-list.
- **checkpoint** — after a meaningful *verified* milestone, `update_document` the same
  record: changed files, evidence, tests, decisions, blockers, next action, new
  timestamp. Never a new doc.
- **handoff** — write a compact handoff state when the session ends, is blocked or is
  transferred; status `handoff` or `blocked`; label verified / inferred / unverified /
  blocked.
- **complete** — record the real completion result with verification commands and
  their outcomes; status `complete`; strikethrough closed items, do not delete. Do not
  mark complete merely because files changed.
- **dry-run** — show the intended read or write (target collection/folder/doc, the
  fields, the redacted body) without calling any write tool.
- **off** — `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/persistence-state.sh off` disables the
  automatic SessionStart rule and the Stop guard below without removing the plugin;
  `... on` re-enables both.
- **setup** — run Onboarding (above) for the current repo.

A `Stop` hook (`scripts/stop-guard.sh`) also runs when a turn ends. If substantive
work (a commit/push/PR, several edits, or a long run of tool calls) happened since
the last Outline write in the transcript, it blocks the stop once and asks the model
to run this skill (checkpoint, handoff or complete) before finishing. For an
unresolved repo it asks for Onboarding (`/setup`) first. It never blocks twice in a
row, it never blocks for an ignored repo, and it never fires when persistence is off
or in a non-interactive run (`claude -p`, SDK). After a block or an Outline write it
stays quiet for a cooldown (30 minutes by default). A decline ("trivial, stopping")
is remembered per session, so the same already-shown work is not blocked again on
the next turn; only new work after the decline triggers another block.

## When to write vs. not

Write at task start, meaningful verified checkpoints, decisions, blockers, handoff and
completion — **not on every tool call**. Don't write trivia obvious from code, or
duplicate existing content (update instead).

## Cross-linking

No orphan docs. Every record links its Plan/Spec where they exist; every doc it
depends on gets a back-link. Add a `## Related` section with `[[doc-title]]` links.
Update the `Tasks` parent every time a record is created, renamed, status-changed or
closed. Never expose `raqz.pl` / `outline.raqz.link` links in public artifacts,
commits or external messages.
